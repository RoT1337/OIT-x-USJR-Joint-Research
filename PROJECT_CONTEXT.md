# USJR × OIT Research Log – Project Context

## Purpose
This project is a prototype web application for the USJR–OIT Joint Research Collaboration.
Its goal is to visually log, track, and communicate research progress, updates, and discussions
related to Wireless Power Transfer (WPT), Rectenna Modeling, and MPPT research.

This is an internal academic coordination tool, not a public product.

## Users
- USJR student researchers (Computer Science background)
- OIT professors and research staff
- Mixed technical background (CS + Electrical Engineering)
- Some users may prefer Japanese explanations

## Core Features (Prototype Scope)
- Research activity log (date-based entries)
- Categories: Rectenna, MPPT, AI, Meetings
- Timeline / feed-style visualization
- Clear authorship (USJR / OIT)
- Mock data only (no backend yet)

## Non-Goals (For This Phase)
- No authentication
- No real-time hardware data
- No full CMS or GitHub replacement
- No production deployment

## Technology Choices
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Styling: Simple, academic, minimal
- Backend: None (mock data only for now)
- AI Translation: Conceptual placeholder only

## Design Philosophy
- Clarity over cleverness
- Visual progress over technical depth
- Easy to explain to professors
- Extendable later to backend / cloud

## AI Assistance Guidelines
- Avoid overengineering
- Prefer readable, maintainable code
- Explain architectural decisions briefly
- Assume TypeScript familiarity
